## Notradamus

NOSTRADAMUS (**NO**wcasting of **S**evere **T**hunderstorms by near-**R**eal-time **A**rtificial Intelligence **D**ata **A**nalysis of **MU**ltiple **S**ensors) is intended to nowcasting Thunderstorms and its hazards. The first module detects and retrieves rainrates from MSG SEVIRI observations.

The algorithm is described in:
